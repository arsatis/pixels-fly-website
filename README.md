## **Introduction**

**Pixels Fly** is a crossover of the all-time favourite indies: Flappy Bird and Temple Run. In this game, we recreated the gameplay of the extremely addictive game Flappy Bird in a 3D world, with each round of the game lasting not more than a few minutes (depending on the playerâ€™s skills). With its simple yet enjoyable game mechanics, we hope that it could attract both game-lovers and casual users, and help them momentarily relieve their stress.

## **The Game**

Pixels Fly is Singaporean-themed. Tap the screen to fly, swipe the screen to switch between lanes. Players would begin with a tutorial which ends after they reach a score of 80.

This is the poster that we designed for the game. The main features and implementation details of the game are highlighted in the poster. The 3 birds perching on the gameplay picture are the various **Pixels Fly** avatars -- each of them has their own unique skill!

**Pixels Fly** brings you on a journey along the Singaporean roads. Collect coins and protective armour, while avoiding collisions into traffic lights, signboards, MRT trains! Beware -- a certain machine awaits you for your bird tax. Here are some screenshots of the **Pixels Fly** game. Find the machine in the screenshots below! *(it is pretty well hidden)*
